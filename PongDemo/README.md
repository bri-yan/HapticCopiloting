# Haptic Co-piloting Pong Demo
This is a simple demo of the Haptic Co-piloting system. It is a two-player game based on Pong, where one player controls the paddle with a mouse and the other player controls the paddle with a twiddlerino device. The goal of the game is to keep the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen. The game ends when the ball hits the bottom of the screen, and the player with the highest score wins.

## Setup
1. `cd` into the `HapticCopiloting/PongDemo` directory
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python pong.py`
